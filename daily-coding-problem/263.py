"""
Create a basic sentence checker that takes in a stream of characters and determines whether they form valid sentences.
If a sentence is valid, the program should print it out.

We can consider a sentence valid if it conforms to the following rules:

1. The sentence must start with a capital letter, followed by a lowercase letter or a space.
2. All other characters must be lowercase letters, separators (,,;,:) or terminal marks (.,?,!,â€½).
3. There must be a single space between each word.
4. The sentence must end with a terminal mark immediately following a word.
